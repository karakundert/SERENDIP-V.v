Copied the function xyzeq() as it exists in s4 program s4precess to s4dop_xyzeq()
in s4doppler.cc.

08/03/06 mattl
Major cleanup. Moved s4coord, s4tel, s4time into lib as well, and their
respective .h files into include. Then did a massive "sed" to convert any
reference of "s4" into "seti_" to make this library more generic. Also
cleaned up a bunch of compiler warnings, and moved any few defines and macros
from SIREN.h into the appropriate .h files in include/.

08/03/06 jeffc
Added a new file, seti_tapeutils.h, that contains 1 template - seti_GetDr2Data().  
This will extract dr2 data from tapes, disk buffers, quicklooks (they all have 
the same format).

Fixed a bug in seti_GetDr2Data.

        seti_tapeutils.h

This is an interim checkin of the interface to dr2 data.

      headers
    - finish setting up autoconfiguration for this CVS module

New function seti_StructureDr2Data() returns a channel of data
along with it's headers.  The function determines which dsi to
look for by way of the channel number.

The typical application will obtain a vector of dr2 data as per 
the example in demo/format_dr2_data.cc.

Still to do:
    - hook up the calculation of RA/Dec for beam 0 and the calculation
      of the center frequency.
    - populate scram_tt.{TurretDegreesAlfa, TurretDegreesTolerance}.
    - finish setting up autoconfiguration for this CVS module

    Added these fields to class dataheader_t: 
    double            ra;             // ra for the beam from which the data in this block came
    double            dec;            // dec for the beam from which the data in this block came
    double            coord_jd;       // julian day time stamp for ra/dec
    double            data_jd;        // julian day time stamp for the final data sample in this block
    
    and removed these fields from same:
    beam0_ra
    beam0_dec

    Note that the new fields are initialized to zero but that is all.  Code
    to populate them will follow.

    new classes seconds, hours, minutes, days, *_years and seti_time.

    include/
        seti_time.h
    src/
        seti_time.cpp

11/22/06 jeffc
    Made all time values in class dataheader_t of type seti_time.
    Added code for constructor seti_time(char * AST).
    Added a ut2_utc_diff() stub that just returns zero.
    Added a dumb little print method to seti_time to help in debugging.
    Commented out code that referenced fields in class receiver_config
        that do not yet exist.  This should not affect current functioning.
    Dummied out the printing of the time values in the dataheader_t print
        method because this are now non-POD (Plain Old Data) types that
        need proper print methods.

    Caveats....
    The AST code compiles and produces reasonable "looking" julian days
    but is not, I think, really correct.  There may be a day offset 
    issue, maybe a deeper problem.  I will be debugging this.  This
    checkin is so that development that depends on having seti_times
    within dataheader_t can move forward.

    Added -lsocket and -lnsl to the m4 definition of INFORMIX_LIBS.
    Added some needed headers to demo/{print_dr2_data.cpp, print_dr2_headers.cpp}.
    Also commented out the inclusion of timecvt.h from these two programs.  The
    definition of JD0 in timecvt.h conflicted with that which is in seti_time.h. 
    Also, the inclusion of timecvt.h was not needed.

    Lots of mods to print_dr2_data_all.

    Print 1s and 0s instead of 1s and -1s in print_dr2_data.  The
