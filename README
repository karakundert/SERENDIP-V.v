OPERATION: 

	COMPILE: make plotter
	RUNNING: ./readdata_continuous <data file>

Jan 05, 2012: Fixed up readdata_continuous to produce eps files from plots in
grace. In order to make a pdf file, use the command:

	ps2pdf plots.eps

Jan 06, 2012: Modified readdata_continuous to produce a plain text file with
the data listed in order of spectra number, beam number, coarse bin number, and power
value. Collects the first 140 spectra and writes them to the file spectraldata.
